### Public Health \| Epidemiology \| Molecular Biology

The last decade has brought about incredible advances in sequencing technologies, which have increasingly been leveraged for public health surveillance as well as outbreak detection and investigation. Successfully using genomic data requires a collaborative team and expertise across multiple disciplines including laboratory science, bioinformatics, and epidemiology. It has been exciting to see over the past decade how each of these fields has evolved.

I've been fortunate to attend many different conferences and training sessions, one of my favorite being the Advanced Molecular Detection Academy in 2019. If you look hard, you'll find me in the middle!

### **Resources for genomic epidemiology in public health**

-   **CDC's Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD)** [page](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/index.html) has a collection of resources and links out to additional resources such as the Pathogen Genomics Centers of Excellence. Another resource from AMD that I worked on with them is the [CDC Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/training/covid-19-gen-epi-toolkit.html). It's a great resource and easy to work through since each module is self-contained and 10 minutes or less.

-   **The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)** has an Advanced Molecular Detection subcommittee that meets regularly and provides webinars. Interested CSTE members can join the meetings, and webinar recordings are available to all [here](https://www.cste.org/page/WebinarLibrary).

-   **The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)** provides training and resources through their Annual meeting as well as other special topics meetings, trainings and webinars that you can search through [here](https://www.aphl.org/training/Pages/All-Laboratory-Training-Events-Search.aspx).

-   **State Public Health Bioinformatics Group (STAPH-B)** is a consortium of bioinformaticians in public health working together to overcome barriers and share best practices. Recorded meetings and other trainings are linked through their [website](https://staphb.org/).

-   **An applied genomic epidemiological handbook.** by Alli Black and Gytis Dudas, available [here](https://alliblk.github.io/genepi-book/).

-   **Wellcome Connecting Science** offers a variety of genomics and bioinformatics courses through [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/wellcome-genome-campus)

-   **Food Safety Centers of Excellence** offers a number of webinars and self-paced courses through their [website](https://foodsafetycoe.org/products/)
