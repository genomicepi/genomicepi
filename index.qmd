**Krisandra Allen, MPH, MB(ASCP)^CM^**

I'm an epidemiologist with a background in molecular biology and experience in public health at a local health department, state health department, public health laboratory, and in the private sector. My favorite area of public health practice has always been foodborne and enteric disease, and I have a special place in my heart for norovirus (and once held the official job title of "norovirus epidemiology specialist"). I love bringing together my two areas of experience (lab + epi) to advance the use of genomic epidemiology in public health.
