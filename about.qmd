Public Health \| Epidemiology \| Molecular Biology

The last decade has brought about incredible advances in sequencing technologies, which have increasingly been leveraged for publich health surveillance as well as outbreak detection and investigation. Successfully using genomic data requires a collaborative team and expertise across multiple disciplines including laboratory science, bioinformatics, and epidemiology. It has been exciting to see over the past decade how each of these fields has evolved.

I've been fortunate to attend many different conferences and training sessions, one of my favorite being the Advanced Molecular Detection Academy in 2019. If you look hard, you'll find me in the middle!

One exciting project I worked on to help facilitate the use of genomic data in public health is the [CDC Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/training/covid-19-gen-epi-toolkit.html). In addition to the module I worked on, walking through Nextstrain trees, there modules on UsHER, wastewater, MicrobeTrace and more! It's a great resource and easy to work through since each module is self-contained and 10 minutes or less.
