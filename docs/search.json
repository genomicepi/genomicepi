    "text": "Public Health | Epidemiology | Molecular Biology\nThe last decade has brought about incredible advances in sequencing technologies, which have increasingly been leveraged for public health surveillance as well as outbreak detection and investigation. Successfully using genomic data requires a collaborative team and expertise across multiple disciplines including laboratory science, bioinformatics, and epidemiology. It has been exciting to see over the past decade how each of these fields has evolved.\nI’ve been fortunate to attend many different conferences and training sessions, one of my favorite being the Advanced Molecular Detection Academy in 2019. If you look hard, you’ll find me in the middle!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne exciting project I worked on to help facilitate the use of genomic data in public health is the CDC Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit. In addition to the module I worked on, walking through Nextstrain trees, there modules on UsHER, wastewater, MicrobeTrace and more! It’s a great resource and easy to work through since each module is self-contained and 10 minutes or less.\nOne critical piece of making genomic data more accessible and widely used, is software tools that allow for visualization and integration of epidemiologic data with sequencing data. One of the first tools I learned was MicrobeTrace from the CDC. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to present my poster below as it was scheduled for a conference in March of 2020 that never happened due to COVID-19, but it shows a few of the capabilities of MicrobeTrace.\n\n\n\nPoster designed for the 2019 Integrated Foodborne Outbreak and Response Meeting\n\n\nAnother tool I used extensively during foodborne disease outbreak investigations is the NCBI Pathogen Detection Portal. NCBI has done a great job making this tool accessible, and it allows you to either browse through sequences, or search for a specific sequence of interest. Another great feature about this tool is that it makes it easy to export both metadata files (CSV or TSV) and phylogenetic tree files (Newick) which can then be used easily in other programs.\nMicroreact is one of the programs that can be used to further explore the data from NCBI (among many other possible inputs and uses). Below is a screenshot of an example project where I took publicly available data on a cluster of Legionella and used that to create a Microreact project. If you want to check it out live and click around, you can go here.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a Microreact project"
