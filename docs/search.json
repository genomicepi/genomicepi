You’ll find various pages with information about trainings, graduate programs, and genomic epidemiology jobs.\nPlease look around, and reach out if there are any resources you think would be helpful that aren’t included.\n\n\nPublic Health | Epidemiology | Molecular Biology\nThe last decade has brought about incredible advances in sequencing technologies, which have increasingly been leveraged for public health surveillance as well as outbreak detection and investigation. Successfully using genomic data requires a collaborative team and expertise across multiple disciplines including laboratory science, bioinformatics, and epidemiology. It has been exciting to see over the past decade how each of these fields has evolved."
