My favorite area of public health practice has always been foodborne and enteric disease, and I have a special place in my heart for norovirus (and once held the official job title of “norovirus epidemiology specialist”).\n\n\n\nSunrise in Kingston, Washington"

    "text": "Public Health | Epidemiology | Molecular Biology\nThe last decade has brought about incredible advances in sequencing technologies, which have increasingly been leveraged for publich health surveillance as well as outbreak detection and investigation. Successfully using genomic data requires a collaborative team and expertise across multiple disciplines including laboratory science, bioinformatics, and epidemiology. It has been exciting to see over the past decade how each of these fields has evolved.\nI’ve been fortunate to attend many different conferences and training sessions, one of my favorite being the Advanced Molecular Detection Academy in 2019. If you look hard, you’ll find me in the middle!\n\nOne exciting project I worked on to help facilitate the use of genomic data in public health is the CDC Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit. In addition to the module I worked on, walking through Nextstrain trees, there modules on UsHER, wastewater, MicrobeTrace and more! It’s a great resource and easy to work through since each module is self-contained and 10 minutes or less.\nOne of my favorite tools for visualizing genomic epi data is MicrobeTrace from the CDC. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to present my poster below as it was scheduled for a conference in March of 2020 that never happened due to COVID-19."
