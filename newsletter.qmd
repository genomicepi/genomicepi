I periodically publish a newsletter that covers topics ranging from my career experience in public health to genomic epidemiology current topics. See the most recent posts below, and visit <https://genomicepi.substack.com/> to view all posts and subscribe.

Do you have something you think would be a great topic? Reach out and I'm happy to work with you if it fits the genomic epidemiology theme!
