Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern, and one of the challenges of raising awareness is the complexity of the problem. There are so many different pathogens and resistance mechanisms!

Enter, games! Games are a great way to introduce complex topics in a fun and engaging way.

Pathogen Pursuit: A Hospital Whodunit is played like a detective game, but instead of solving a crime, players race to solve an outbreak in a hospital! The game features different Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) and an intrepid outbreak investigation team. Players will learn about different bacterial species often associated with hospital-acquired infections as well as different carbapenemenases that are contributing to the global crisis of antimicrobial resistance.

## Game Debut at the 2024 ECCMID Conference

I'll be presenting the game and have it available for play in the Science Play Corner at the ECCMID conference in Barcelona in a few short weeks! Stop by my presentation to say hello and play a round!

#### The making of Pathogen Pursuit: A Hospital Whodunit

One of my hobbies is designing and creating projects with a computer-guided laser. I've done a number of science-themed projects (such as a water bottle covered in the first page of a friend's publication) and used these as a jumping off point to create the game. Creating the game was a fun way for me to combine my love of microbiology, public health, and creative laser work!
