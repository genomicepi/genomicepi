Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern, and one of the challenges of raising awareness is the complexity of the problem. There are so many different pathogens and resistance mechanisms!

Enter, games! Games are a great way to introduce complex topics in a fun and engaging way.

Pathogen Pursuit: A Hospital Whodunit is a classic mystery game, but instead of solving a murder, players race to solve an outbreak in a hospital! The game features different Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and an intrepid outbreak investigation team.
